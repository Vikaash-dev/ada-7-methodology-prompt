## 📈 User Experience Improvements

### Before (v1.0)
```
User: "Build a web app"
AI: [Wall of text with all 7 stages mixed together]
User: "Uh... okay? Where do I start?"
```

### After (v2.0)
```
User: "Build a web app"
AI: "Let me help! First, let's configure your project.

What's your:
1. Complexity level? (Startup MVP / Enterprise)
2. Team size? (Solo / Small / Medium)
3. Timeline? (Urgent / Normal / Extended)

Or use /config to set manually, or /stage1 to begin with defaults."

User: "/config complexity 'Startup MVP'"
AI: "✅ Updated complexity to 'Startup MVP'

This affects:
- Simpler architecture recommendations
- Faster iteration cycles
- Cost-conscious choices
- MVP-focused scope

Ready? Use /stage1 to begin requirements analysis."

User: "/stage1"
AI: [Clean, structured output with self-assessment]

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked

1. **Visual Hierarchy is Critical**
   - Unicode box-drawing characters
   - Emojis for quick reference
   - Clear section separators

2. **Specificity Beats Generality**
   - "3-5 repos" > "several repos"
   - Exact versions > "latest"
   - Numbered metrics > vague terms

3. **Configuration Enables Personalization**
   - Pre-defined options work better than freeform
   - Context shapes all recommendations
   - One size definitely doesn't fit all

4. **Commands Improve Navigation**
   - Familiar "/" prefix from chat apps
   - Clear, intuitive naming
   - Predictable behavior

5. **Examples Drive Understanding**
   - One complete example > thousand words
   - Show format AND content
   - Demonstrate quality standards

6. **Anti-Patterns Prevent Errors**
   - Equally important as patterns
   - Prevent common mistakes
   - Save time and frustration

7. **Self-Assessment Builds Trust**
   - Acknowledge limitations
   - Show confidence levels
   - Flag when uncertain

8. **Hidden Thinking Cleans Output**
   - Users want results, not process
   - Keep internal reasoning hidden
   - Show only final recommendations

### What to Avoid

1. **Wall of Text**: No matter how good the content
2. **Vague Requirements**: Be specific or ask
3. **Implicit Logic**: Make everything explicit
4. **Single Option**: Always provide alternatives
5. **No Examples**: Show, don't just tell
6. **Ignoring Context**: One size doesn't fit all
7. **No Validation**: Built-in quality checks essential
8. **Static Approach**: Enable adaptation and refinement
